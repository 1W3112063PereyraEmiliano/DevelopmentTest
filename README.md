This is a develop test for the software enterprise Emser.

# ---------------------------------------> DevelopmentTest Service
## Requirements

*Python*
I did work with Python 3, the Python's version was 3.8.10 but you can work with whatever you want, it should only be compatible with the libraries found in the file: requirements.txt. 
I recommend 3.8.10 for more compatibility.

*Pip*
The pip's version was 20.0.2.

*Env (Optional)*
You should create a virtual env to work orderly.
### Initial Configuration

Install all requirements from requirements.txt file. 
Type this in your terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt
*Remember*: you should be on the path where the requirements.txt file is located.
If any requirement causes an error, it is a Python compatibility issue. (Send me: emilianoemser@gmail.com)

When you have installed all the requirements, the next step is run the Service.
¿How?
Type this in your terminal: python3 comms.py
*Remember*: you should be on the path where the comms.py file is located.
